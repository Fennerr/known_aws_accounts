# Known AWS accounts
This repository contains known AWS account IDs (those used by vendors and AWS services).  The purpose of this is so when a trust relationship or CloudTrail events show an AWS account ID that is unknown to you, you can more quickly identify the purpose of that account. This is meant to be used with tools to remove the need for manual web searches.
